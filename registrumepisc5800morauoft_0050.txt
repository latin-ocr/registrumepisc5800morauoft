leaving three sons, Hugo, William, and Andrew.

Andrew was a witness to a

charter of Hugo to Gilbert the Archdeacon, between 1203 and 1214, and nothing

more is known of him.

Hugo was the founder of the House of Suthcrland3

William was ancestor of the families of De Moravia of Duffus and Petty.

HUGo ansxrn¹ appears as witness to a charter of King William between 1194
and 1199 to the Abbey of Kinloss‚¹¹¹ and again between 1203 and 1211.¹¹ It

is quite uncertain whether he aequired from the Crown, or inherited, the territory

of Sutherland. Lord Hailes, whose conjectures in regard to this family carry more

than their usual weight‚ suggests that the family of Freskinus may have received a
grant of South Caithness or Sutherland on the forfeiture of Harald Earl of Caith-

ness in the reign of William; and that from the power of the old family, and the

distance and the disturbed state of the territory, the gift may have remaincd for some

fact of his having considerable southern pro-
perty as early at least, if not before his nor-
thern possessions, throws doubt upon this
theory3 which becomes highly improbable,
when we consider that the immediate descend-
ants of FreskinuS, possessing great power and
territory in the district of Moray, and versant
in writing and eharter transactions, never, either
for proiit or honour, asserted such a descent,
nor pushed their patronymic pcdigree higher
than this marked ancestor. Chalmers, on the
other hand, building·¹ it would seem, on no
other foundation than the peculiarity of the
name, which he perhaps interpreted to mean a
native of Frisia, has claimed the ancestor of De
Moravia as one ofhis favourite band of Flemish
colonists. 1t might certainly be stated, in sup-
port of this theory, ist, 'l‘hat Berowaldus, a
Fleming, settled in the immediato neighbour-
hood of Frcskinus in Moray about thc time
assigned sor his settlement; and the earliest
notice of the family preserved, is the appear-
ance of his son as a witness to that Berowald-
us's charter; 2cI, 'l'hat the family of Douglas,
with whom wc find the early De Moravias
most intimately connected, owed its rise, al-
though in another part os Scotland, to a Fle-
mish scttler, about the same period. Many a
point of pedigree, especially in Scotland, has
been rested on worse foundations.

¹ It seems to be presumed by Lord Hailes,
and it has been asserted by Chalmers and
others, that this personage was not the son os
F reskinus, but his grandson, and the same pcr-
son with Hugh Lord of Duffus who was saint-
ed.——Ilailcs Aun. 1222. Itis confessed that this
is more consistent with chronology and more
easily reconcilable with some of the occurrenccs
of other membcrs of the family ; and is the per-
sonage occurred with an ambiguous style only,
as Willelmus filins Freslqsn, Huqofilius suus, or
Huyo Res-hyn, it might be difficult to resist that
consideration. But when we find the two
brothers clearly designated “ Willclmus filius
“ Freskyn, [layo filius Reskyn'⁸ in a char-ter,
certainly between 1194 and 1199—(Shaw, Ap-
pendi1, p. 406)-it requires greater impedi-
ments than wc here meet with, or more insor-
mation than we yet possess, to overcome such
a direct testimony. Whichever way the ques-
tion be decided, the pedigree of Hugh F reskyn
dotcnwards is not affected. But it must be no-
ticed that hc carries with him two brothers,
William and Andrcw, who arc known by that
designation.
