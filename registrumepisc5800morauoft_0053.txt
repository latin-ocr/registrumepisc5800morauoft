He inherited the lands of Duffus and Strabrok. He had assumed the name of De
Moravia, and was styled Lord of Duffus before 1203.¹ He continues to appear
in the transactions of the Chartulary between 1203 and 1224. ¹⁶ He was dead in
1226,1 and was buried in the Church of Duffus, near the altar of St Katharine, as
we learn by a note on the margin of the older Chartulary‚ in a hand apparently
of the fifteenth century : ¹¹²¹-—

And at a charter granted by his son Walter‚¹¹ endowing a chaplainry in the
Church of Duffus‚—where he is styled Walterus de Illoruviafilius Huqonz‘s de Mo-
ravz‘a—a scribe of the fifteenth century has interpolated the word—heati-before
Huyom's. From these notes it appears that he was canonized, or at least obtained
the character of sanctity for his benefactions to the Chureh. He had two sons,— Α
Walter, who succeeded him,—and AndreW‚ who was Parson of Duffus during his
father's lifetime and during the Episcopate of Bishop Bricius‚ ⁰ whom he succeeded
as Bishop of Moray in 1222.

very frequently between 1224 and 1242.1² He married Eufemia, probably a
daughter of Ferchar Earl of Ross.q He was dead in 1262-3, ¹ and was buried
with his father in the Church of Duffus, as appears from a former quotation, and
from the following note on the margin of the older Chartulary against a charter of
