XXXVI

Fazsxmus De Mox-avia, Lord of Duffus, was the son and heir of Walter. He
occurs frequently in the register between 1248 and 1263Ἷ In a composition
between him and Simon Bishop of Moray, we learn that he held the lands of
Logie by grants of the Bishops predecessors to his great-grandfather and great-
great-grandfather (proavo ec attavo ¹⁴). He occurs in public life as a party to the
treaty with the Welsh in 1258. ¹ His wife was Johanna, of what family is un-
known, who was propriet0r‚ apparently in her own right, of extensive lands in
Strathnavir. v He was dead in 1269, ² and was buried in the Chapel of St Law-
rence, in the Church of Duffus, as we learn from the following notes, marked in a
hand of the fifteenth century, upon the margin of the older Chartulary : ²—

He left his property divided between two daughters and co-heiresses‚ Mary and
Christian.

Cunrs'rnm, who occurs from 1269 to 1294, b seems to have had a portion of the
lands of Duffus and Strabrok, and four dauachs of land in Strath11avir.⁶ She
married william de Federeth‚ who was Constable of Roxburgh in 1262.ἀ Their
son— Willa'am lefiz William de Federed, del Counte de Elqyn en Morref-—did homage
to Edward in 1296.e The family of De Federeth seems to have ended in an
heiress, probably his daughter, in the time of David II. f
