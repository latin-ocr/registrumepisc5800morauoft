have blazoned out of a conjunction of a coat of three stars only, with an augmentation
osa heart. It was not till two generations after, that the marriage of Archibald the
Grim with the heiress of Pettie and Bothwell entitled him to assume the arms of that
braneh of De Moravia, which he bore on an escutcheon of pretence over his own
coat of Douglas and Galloway quarterly. t

The length to which these genealogical details have already emended, renders it
impossible to collect the minute facts showing the intimacy and apparent connexion
between those families, and tending to establish that the House of Douglas owed the
beginning of its greatness to that yet undiscovered affinity with the De Moravias
which led to its adoption of their arms.

It only remains to explain that the plan which has been adopted, of printing witb-
out abbreviations from an excessively abbreviated MS., has imposed the necessity of
determining many doubtful words and passagesu that might‘ have been left in their
original ambiguity in another mode of editing. The accurate student of these anti-
quities should not take such readings on the authority of an editor-3 and the Tabula

wiek, and which gives a sess—three stars iu
chief ; a beart in base, with the legend . siyil-
Ivm . willelmi . de . douqlas . After he was
created an Earl, he bore the same arms of a
heart, with three stars on a chief, the shield
supported by a single lion couchant: (Melros
Ch.) After his marriage with the heiress of
Mar, when he assumed that title, his arms were,
quarterly l and 4, Douglas, a heart3 on a chief
three stars3 2 and 3, a bend between six cross
crosslets fitche‚ for Mar.—( Ch. in archiv. publ.
Edin.)

t Gla. anno 1401, in archiv. publ„ where the
arms are—quarterly ; l and 4 Douglas, a beart,
on a chief three stars; 2 and 3 Galloway, a lion
rampant crowned. Over all, an inescutcheon,
Moray, three stars, 2 and l.

¹¹ As 311 instance of these ambiguities, the
name of W. Pratt, who occurs as a witness in
N. 71, 72, and 109, is written at these three
places in the following manners :-N. 71. Η.
decano Rossefi. vie moi. Th. Hostia? de In-
uernys. .W. Prath de Inuemarr. R. de forays,
&c. fizl. 29.—N. 72. Th. Hostia? vie de Inuer-
nys. Walto Pram vii de Inuernarf. Rieu vie

de forays. Aleio vie de Elgyn, &c. fol. 29.-
N. 109. Thoma host. Wfflo pra? vicario de
Inflnarn, διο. fol. 73. The writer was probably
mistaken in each of these instanees. This person⁷s
name appears to have been William, and he was
Sheriff of Nairn—-vicecomes de Invernaryn-—in
1227.-·Robertson's Index.

In like manner, Alexander Douglas, the bro-
ther of Bishop Bricius, occurs ten times in the
older chartulary with the designation—“ vi'c' de
Elgyn.'' (N. 28,fl›l. 19. N. 30,fi2l. l5,fol. 39.
N. 31, sol. 39. Ν. 33, fol. 42. N. 35, fol. 41,
fol. 18. N. 95‚fol. 22. N. 96,f0l. 29. N. 120,
fol. 21.) He occurs twice, written—‘¹ vicec‘ de
Elgyn” (N. 31,fol. 15. N. 33, jbl. 18.), and
once—“ Alei vicecomii de Elgyn'' (N. 28, fol.
43). Yet at N. 211, this person and his brother
witness a charter of Bishop Bricius as ‘¹ Alex-

andro et Henrico canonicis de Spyny fratribus “

nostris.'' Are we to hold that the engrossers of
the ancient records of the Bishopric, thrice wrote
the abbreviation of vicecomes instead of that for
vicarius ; or is it to be admitted that the church-
man and Canon of the Cathedral held also the
lay office of Sheriff of the Shire?
