Gilbert de Moravia of Culbyn. It is dated at the chapel of Saint Andrew at Gold—
espy, from which it may be concluded that the family had before that date settled
at Dunrobin. Earl Kenneth was killed at the battle of Halidon Hill‚ 1333. He
was succeeded by his son

Wmmffl Earl of Sutherland‚ who married Margaret, daughter of Robert Ι.
The family name in his time was still De Moravia or De Murref. His son and
successor was called, during his father's life, William De Murrif. ¹ It is only neees-

ern. Υ The subsequent pedigrce of Sutherland is too well known to the historian
and lawyer, from the labours of Lord Hailes, to require notice here.
