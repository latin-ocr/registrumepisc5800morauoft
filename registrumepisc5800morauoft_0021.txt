concerning the Hospital of Saint Nicholas beside the bridge of Spey,¹‘ and the
munimepts of the Domus Dei or Maison Dieu, a hospital, probably for lepers,
adjoining the town of Elgin.¹

After these follow a miscellaneous collection of deeds, several leaves occasionally
being devoted to one subject, but in general entered without regard to the order of
subject or date.¹¹¹ Nearly the whole of this part has been written before the destruction
of the original writs 3 but it is impossible to determine whether it consisted, like the
previous part, of several detached registers, or was the general record of the Church,

solio 115 is the conclusion of the records of the Cathedral, so far as they were written
before its destruction in 1390, and collected soon afterwards. Then we find a few
charters of the fifteenth century in favour of the Bishoprick‚ ¹¹ entered apparently
nearly contemporaneously‚ and pass rapidly to the charters of alienation, imme-
diately preceding and following the Reformation, which occupy the remainder of the
volume.

The other register of this diocese ⁰ was once well-known by the name of the Red
Book of the Church of Moray, and was, for a few years preceding the Reformation‚
the formal book of record of the proceedings of the Bishop and the Chapter. Ρ It is
a thick volume of 320 leaves of parchment, besides six leaves inserted before the

commcncement of the numbers:

The carta Bricii is still the first charter of the
volume, and the tale of the notary is to this day

of publication of certain investitures, joined with
a war-rant by the Commissary of Mor-ay for their
registration “ in Reqistro et libro rubeo ecclesie

nations of church lands (ibid. f. 155. 158. 160.

mentioned, the registration seems to have taken
