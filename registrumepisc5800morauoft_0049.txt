Undoubtedly the greatest interest of a publication like the present arises from the
early mention of places and lands and families. *There are no great estates in the
diocese of Moray which are not more or less illustrated by this register‚ and there are
only two or three that do not occur here earlier than in any other authentic record.
The chartulary, indeed, may be said to furnish a history of the tenure and transmis-
sion ot' property within the diocese, from the first subjection of the province to Royal
authority and the introduction of written titles, down to the period of the Reforma-
tion. So extensive and so scattered were the possessions of the Church in Moray,
that the Bishop was brought into contact, in one way or another, with all the great
proprietors of the district, and it is to the system of recording which was so laudably
practised by the Church, that the most ancient families of the province are indebted
for the proofs of their pcdigrees.

Among the munificent benefactors of the Church of Moray, the family of De
Moravia is perhaps, on all accounts, the most interesting. It seems, in the early
part of these records, to be but recently settled in the province 3 its connexions
and origin alike unknown3 and yet we find it suddenly in possession of a vast
extent of territory, building stately castles, larg-ely endowing the Church, and in a
very few generations producing an unexampled number of cadent lines, each of
them taking a high rank in its own district of Scotland.

Itis now vain to push our researches beyond Freskinus, of whom all we know
is, that he held the lands of Strabrok‚ in Linlithgow‚ and Duffus with a great
neighbouring territory, in Moray, from David I. k He must have died before 1171,
