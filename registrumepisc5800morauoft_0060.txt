The identity of the name may not go far in a proof of connexion of two families.
But the identity of name and arms together appears to prove, either that the families
are connected, or that the early branches of one of them chose to have it so believed.
Of the arms of the first two generations of the Perthshire De Moravias, we have no
evidence. No monuments or seals of theirs are preserved. John, the son of Sir
Maleolm, did not display on his seal any shield or coat-armour. His badge or cog-
nizance was a bull pas-sant. If any allusion was there made to his descent, it is per-
haps to be found in a star placed over the bull's back.¹² But from the time when
any heraldic bearing was introduced among them, the Perthshire De Moravias and
all their cadets have borne the same arms with the Northern family. It is true,
indeed, that the tine-tures of the arms of the Southern families of the name of Moray
differ from those of the family of Sutherland‚ and from each other3 but it is to be
observed, that the only authentic evidence of early heraldry, the sculpture of tombs
and other buildingS‚ and seals‚¹ furnish no information regarding the tinctures of
the blazoning. It must be remembered also, that in Scotland at least, a change of
tinctures has been, from a very early period, a favourite mode of differencing the
arms of cadets.

The three stars, forming the charge of the arms of some of the earliest settled
families of Moray,¹= has given rise to the notion that this was originally the arms
of the province. There is no reason, however, to believe that any district in Scot-
land claimed aneiently a peculiar coat of arms distinct from that of the lords of
the territory3 and it seems more natural to conclude, that one family of great pos-
sessions and power, having adopted arms at the first introduction of heraldry, was
readily followed and imitated by its connexions, dependants, and neighbours. This
has certainly happened in other districts of Scotland 3¹ and when we consider the
vast possessions of the first descendants of Freskinus‚ we may easily conceive their

influence in Moray to have been little less than if they had been the territorial lords
of the province.
