1f the distinctive marks osan Eastern origin be so conspicuous as is alleged, it ean
hardly be accounted for by the conquests and revolutions of the province with which
the imperfect history of the North acquaints us. We are told by the Norse writers that
Moray, with a great part of the North of Scotland, was occasionally under Norwegian
rule, and independent of the Crown of Scotland, for the greater part of two cen-
turies. Thorstein the Red, Sigurd, and Thorfin, ruled either with avowed inde-
pendence, or with only a nominal acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the Scottish
monarchs, from the beginning of the tenth to the middle of the eleventh century.
About the termination of their sway, the feeble light of our own history begins to
dawn, and presents us with a succession of native lords of Moray, whose names only
are preserved, but who appear to have been in some way connected with the reigning
family of Scotland, and to have drawn their followers into frequent ruinous insurrec-
tions, either in maintaining their claims to the throne, or in resisting the authority of
the ruling sovereign.¹ These were at length terminated only by the expulsion of the

out dates or events, differing from each other,
and osten inconsistent with chronology.

These remarks are by no means intended to
discourage the study of such authorities. In the
absence of better information‚ they are neccs-
sary for the early history of Scotland. But they
require to be carefully compared, and received
with caution. Above all, it must be eonfessed,
we still want in Scotland that fairness, and free-
dom from sectarian bias towards a favourite
system, and that wholesome scepticism, which
are at the foundation of historical truth.

¹ Gillcomqain Mac-Maolhryd, maormor of
Murevc, appears to have been the son of Maol-
bryd, the son of Ruaidhri, and was thus cousin-
german of stlacbelln who seems to have been the
son of Finnlaech, the son of the same Ruaidhri.
Mr Skcne, whose authority is of great wcight,
is of opinion that the Malcolm Mac-Maellniqdi
of Tiqhernac and the Ulster annals, who died in
1029, was really King of Scotland “ ri Allum'*
—as he is stylcd by Tithrnam-—though heis
omitted by our historiam, who join his reign to
that of Malcom Mtxenneth, his successor, who
died in 1034. lt is to be obser-ved, however, that
Finnlaech, the father of Macbcth‚ has the same

style in the Ulster annals (“ ri Alban”) which
Tighernac gives to his nephow Maleolm. Gill-
comyain was burnt in 1032.

Lulaclz Mac. Gillcomyain, maormor of Mures,
succeeded his father. He was set up for king
after Maebeth's death* in 1058. Three months
afterwards he was defeated and killed at Essy
in Strathbolgy by Malcolm 111. The son of
Lulach, styled by the Irish annalists

MoeLsnectai, succeeded as maormor. He died
—suam vitam infeliciter finivit—in 1085 ς and
was succeeded by

Anyus, whose connexion with his predecessore
is unknown. He several times rebelled and set
himself up for king. In his last and most for-
midable insurrection, he seems to have possessed
himself of the whole Northern districts of Scot-
land, until he was defeated and slain at Stra-
eathro in 1130. Like tho other Maormors of
Scotland, he began to be stylcd Earl.

From a chartcr copied by Selden, the authen-
ticity of which is questioned by Chalmers, it
appears that Gillocher, Earl of Mar, held also
the Earldom of Moray; and that his son Mor-
gund succeeded him in both Earldoms, in the
year 1171. If that chartcr is to be admitted,-
