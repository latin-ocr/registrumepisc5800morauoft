inhabitants, and the settling of a colony of strangers by Malcolm 1V.=¹-an exertion of
power so extraordinary, that we should hesitate to give it credence unless it were con—
firmed by numerous authorities3 and even when obliged to admit the general truth of
the story, it may be permitted to doubt whether the transmigration was so complete
and extensive as our historians would have us to believe. There is no reason, how-
ever, to doubt that about that time numerous strangers obtained grants of territory
in Moray. Some of these are known to have been previously settled in the Southern
districts of Scotland3 and among them are the once great names of Comyn, Byset‚
Ostiarii‚ and the powerful Earls of Fife and Strathern.
From that time the affairs of Moray have no peculiar interest apart from the
national history. The Royal authority gradually extended and made itself respected ;
'free towns were founded or endowed with new privileges; the Church spread its
civilizing influence 3 and we find the hitherto rebellious province become the frequent
and evidently the peaceful residence of the sovereign. ¹¹
The most accurate information of the condition of the district, the tenure of pro-
perty, the laws and manners of the people, is henceforth derived from the records of
the Episcopal See, which have fortunately been preserved.

mation. There is no reason however, to place its foundation earlier than the reign

and Chalmers's objections are by no means con-
clusive against it‚—it would seem that the Earl of
Mar had obtained a grant of Moray from David
I. upon the forfeiture or the death of Augus.

111 the mean time Wimund‚ or Malcolm
Meneth as he is called by Fordun, asserting
himself to be the son of Augus, had raised a
new insurrection. His whole adventures have
much the air of a bold impostor. But the des-
cent claimed by him serves to confirm the be-
lief produced by the whole imperfect history of
the family—that the ancient maormors or Earls
of Moray had some claim by descent to the
Seottish throne. The pretensions of Wimund
and his family were finally extinguished in
1157.-Hailes‚ 1141, 1157.

Record and tradition are alike silent from that
period with regard to the ancient race of the
Lords of Moray. There is no evidence that the
investitur-e of Gillocher or of Morgund ever took

effect. Their descendants, Earls of Mar, did
not bear the title of Moray, and they have left
no trace of their possessing the territory.

hereditary, since it was conferred the following

ness, and other places in Moray.
