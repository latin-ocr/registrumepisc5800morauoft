ment of the wholesale dilapidation of the See, have been printed in the following
arrangement z—Charters immediately concerning the Bishop or Bishoprick⁸-The
meetings and proceedings of Convocations of the Canons, and their acts and
statutes ²—Endowments of Chaplainries‚ Altarages, and Vicarages within the
Church and Diocese ¹¹—Documents that do not direetly or evidently concern the
Diocese of Moray ¹—Lists of Bishops and Canonries, valuations‚ homages, &c.y .-
Writs perhaps actually used, but inserted apparently as styles for the scribes of the
cathedraJ2-and lastly, A short Chronicle of Events in scotland and England
from 1390 to 1402. ²

After all these classes of matter had been disposed of, a mass remained‚ of
immense bulk in the original, consisting almost entirely of the feu—charters and
leases of lands, and titles granted by the Bishop and Chapter, during the half cen-
tury immediately preceding the Reformation. By that time the conveyancing of
Scotland had become minute and verbose, and the deeds are by no means interesting
in proportion to their length. For the most part, indeed, a pretty uniform style
was adopted3 and it appeared possible to give all that was useful or interesting of
this portion of the chartularies in an abbreviated form, preserving the language and
the operative words of the original deeds, and leaving out the tedious and oft-
repeated clauses of style. This Abbreviate of the later writsb has been arranged
according to the alphabetical order of the lands standing first in each conveyance3
and where more than one deed has reference to a particular portion of lands, they are
classed together in the order of their dates. Three deeds of date subsequent to the
temporary restoration of Episcopacy by J ames VI. ⁶ -a few instruments of late date
commemorating the formal fealty rendered by the Canons to the Bishop ⁶—and two
deeds reeording the foundation of a prebend and certain chaplainriese--in an abridged
form, have been placed at the end of this collection of feu-charters and leases. It
will thus be found, with a few exceptions, that all documents of both chartularies,
prior in date to 1500, are printed at length under one or other of the first eleven
heads, while those of subsequent date are abridged in the twelfth.

After the conclusion of the whole materials of the Chartularies, or proper Register
of the Bishoprick of Moray, it has been deemed proper to print one year's account of the
