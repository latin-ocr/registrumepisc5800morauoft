With regard to the remaining branches of this great tree, there are no docu-
ments yet discovered to enable us to fix their precise point of springing ; and anthat
the present Register‚ with its appendix, can be said to have done in this respect,
is to have brought it somewhat nearer demonstration, that the De Moravias of Tuli-
bardyn and Atholl are of the same common stoek with the houses whose descent is

stated above.
Τὴθ first ascertained person of the Perthshire family of Tulibardyn‚ is Johannes

⁴ ⁰⁷⁸* de Moravia, or John de Murreve, sheriff of Perth in the reign of Alexander ΙΙ. ¹

What were his Perthshire possessions, or his connexion with that county‚ is quite
unknown. It is most probable‚ as is commonly asserted, that he left a son—Sir
Malcolm de Moravia, who was also sheriff of Perthshire, and flourished mostly in the
reign of Alexander III. 7 He is said to have witnessed a charter in the 36th year
of Alexander III‚² and he was dead before 1286.¹ He had two sons, John,¹> who
probably left no heirs, and Sir William.

Sir William de Moravia, knight, inherited lands in Moray from his father Sir
Malcolm. He married Ada, the daughter of Malis, steward of the Earldom of
Stratherne3 and by that marriage, together perhaps with some previous connexion
with the great family of the Earls of Stratherne, he acquired Tulibardyn‚ and other
estates in Perthshire. From him the descent of the Morays of Tulibardyn and
Atholl is clear and well evidenced.

The evidence of their Northern origin may be shortly stated. We find Sir
Malcolm de Moravia proprietor of the lands of Lambride, near Elgin, which he gave
to his son William by a eharter, that from the names of all the witnesses, must
have been executed at Elgin. ⁶ Freskinus de Moravia of Duffus, and his connexion
Sir Reginald le Chen, seem to have visited him in Perffishire, and are witnesses
along with Sir Malcolm in a charter of Malis Earl of Stratherne.

John, the son of Sir Malcolm, was possessed of lands in Strathbolgy, which he
granted to his brother William 3⁶ and these were held of William, Earl of Sutherland,

the head of the house.
Sir William de Moravia, the son of Sir Malcolm, acquired by marriage the lands of
