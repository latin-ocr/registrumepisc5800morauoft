and may be of use to the student of the history and antiquities of the province.

Gneoomus is the first Bishop of Moray on record. He held the See in the end
of the reign of Alexander 1., and the beginning of that of David.

Wxtmm was Bishop of Moray before 1158 or 1159, when he went on a mission

jurisdiction. Richard died in 1203.ι

Bmcws, a son of the house of Douglas, previously Prior of Lesmahagu, probably

seems to have been closely connected with the powerful family of de Moravia, to
which perhaps, he owed his promotion to a benefice so far from his own country.
He was a great benefactor to the Church. He procured the cathedral, formerly
undefined, and held at Birnay, Spyny or Kinnedor, to be fixed at Spyny.¹¹ And it
would appear that he afterwards applied to Rome for its transference to Elgin,¹
though this change did not take effect till after his demise. He founded a chapter of
