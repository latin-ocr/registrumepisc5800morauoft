Wyntoun‚ who is seldomer led away by his imagination than most poets and
chroniclers, has stated the matter very much as it now stands, in spite of the
researches and superior means of information of three centuries :—

“ Of Murrawe and the Dowglas
“ How that thare begynnyng was,

“ Syn syndry men spekis syndryly,
“ Ι can put that in na story.

“ Bot in thare armeys bath thai bere
“ The Sternys set in lyk manere:

‘¹ Til mony meu it is yhit sene

“ Apperand lyk‚ that they had bene

“ Or be branchys collaterale.” Ρ

The fabulous antiquity of Sholto Douglas, the contemporary of King Selvathius,
and his imaginary descendants, has been long abandoned with the other fables of
Scotch pedigree. It seems now to be ascertajned that the family took its origin, or
at least assumed its territorial surname, towards the end of the twelfth century.
Only one or two generations had passed, producing persons of no consideration for
rank or possessions, when a son of the family is found transplanted from his paternal
country, and the little cell of Lesmahagow‚ of which he had been Prior, to the
distant and semi-barbarous but great diocese of Moray, of which he was first Dean,
and subsequently Bishop. Such promotion was not at that time the result merely
of court favour. The election appears to have been in the clergy of the diocese3
and after all allowanee for merit in the successful candidate, it seems to indicate
some connexion with leading persons of the district. The only person between whom
and the new Bishop a precise affinity is stated, is a certain Freskinus de Kerdal, who
is styled by the Bishop “ avunculus noster ,·” all we know of whom is, that he had con-
siderable possessions in the immediate neighbourhood of the territories of the family
of De Moravia 3 and it may be allowed to conjecture, from the peculiarity of his name,
that, if not a member, he was at least a relative of that family. When Bricius
became connected with the Diocese, he appears to have brought with him a band of
brothers, who all figure during his episcopate and that of his successor. Many of
these are at first styled simply the Bishop's brothers ; and even Archibald‚ the head
of the house, and the undoubted ancestor of the chief racc of Douglas‚ has no higher
