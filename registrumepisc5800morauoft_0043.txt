them to its allegiance. The precincts of the cathedral became the neutra] ground
on which alone the opposite factions of a lawless age could meet in safety, and it
established the influence of a little court in that distant province. The permanence
and stability of its power and property, and the high offices of state held by some of
its Bishops, gave the church of Moray more than usual influence in a district liable
to continual revolutions.

The first cathedral, begun probably by Bishop Andrew de Moravia, is said by all
our historians, to have been a very stately fabric, and to have merited the good old
Bishop's expressions of grief for its destruction. ¹ Of that which succeeded, enough
yet remains to entitle it to rank as at once the grandest and the most beautiful of our
cathedrals, if not the most superb edifice of scotland. ¹¹²

With the first of a series, and it is to be hoped a considerable series, of the records
of the secular clergy of Scotland, it would be vain to enquire into the peculiarities
of their constitution and customs‚ which are to be gathered from a comparison of
the whole collected. Although this be not the earliest either in point of date, or of
the transactions recorded, it may be questioned if any other of the Registers of Scot-
tish Bishoprics ⁴ affords more information regarding the early constitution of the
national church, the commencement of the appropriation of tithes, the erection‚ divi-
sion, and union of parishes, and the endowment and manner of life of the rural and
cathedral clergy.

m Elgin, the seat of the Bishopric, long re-
tained a strong impress of its ecclesiastical origin.
Within the memory of some yet alive, it presented
the appearance of a little Cathedral city very
unusual among the burghs of presbyterian Scot-
land. There was an antique fashion of building‚
and withal, a certain solemn, drowsy air about
the town and its inhabitants, that almost pre-
pared a stranger to meet some church proces-

of late. The Church of St Giles of venerable
antiquity‚ has given way to a gay new edi-
fice. The dweninga of the citizens have put on
a modern trim look, which does not satisfy the
eye so well as the sober grcy walls of their
fathers. Numerous hospitals‚ the fruits of
mixed charity and vanity, sur-round the town,
and with their gaudy white domes and porticos,
contrast offensively with the mellow colom-ing
and chaste proportions of the ancient struc-
tures. If the present taste continues, there
will soon be nothing remaining of the reverend
antique town but the ruins of its magnificent
cathedral.
