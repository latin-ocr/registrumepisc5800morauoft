“ is there better meat, nor cheaper corn ; not from scarcity of money, but from the
“ abundance of the soil. The natives (as frequently happens in a fertile soil) are

“ in that art.

“ In the low lands along the coast, the natives suffer inconvenience from the want
“ of turf for fuel, which is the only hardship experienced by that happy region.
“ And that is only felt in a few places, It must be owned that they generally

‘⁶ The soil is dry, and requires frequent showers in summer to produce abundant
‘⁶ crops. It suffers from nothing so much as drought, quite contrary to the neigh-

“ The country is champaign, low, sometimes swelling into pleasant hills3 for

“ such abundance, that there is plenty for all.
“ They swallow it in great draughts, to the
“ astonishment of strangers, for it is excessively
