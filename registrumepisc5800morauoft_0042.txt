What was the extent of the ancient Maormorship or Earldom of Moray we have
no means of ascertaining. Bounded probably by Ross, Lochaber, Athol, Mar, and
the Sea, the frontier districts were too mountainous and of too little value to be the
subject of accurate perambulation3 even if the condition of the Lords of those pro-
vinces had been sufficiently peaceful and submissive to the laws, to respect any limits
but those of their own power.

The diocese of Moray when it began to assume limits from the erection of conter-
minous Bishoprics‚ seems to have extended along the coast from the river Forn, its
boundary with Ross, to the Spey. Bounded by Lochaber on the West‚ it included
the country surrounding Loch-Ness‚ the valleys of the Nairn and Findhorn, Bade-
noch and Strathspey‚ the valleys of the Avon and Fiddich, and all the upper part of
Banffshire, eomprehending Strathyla, and Strathbogie in Aberdeenshire‚ but not
extending into the districts of Einzic and Boyne. ¹‘

diocese of Moray long rankcd as the greatest of the northern Bishoprics. Numbering
many of the great Barons among its vassals, wielding much real power and wealth,
and availing itself of its influcnce over the opinions of men, the Church of Moray,
though often harassed by its violent ncighbours, seldom failed of ultimately reducing
