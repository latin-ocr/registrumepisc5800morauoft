The first portion, which consists of a transcript of the older chartulary, already
described, is written continuously, and by the same hand. At the conclusion of this
partos the work, we find a docquet recording the name of the scribe, and the number
of leaves written 3‘1 from which we learn that the first portion of the volume was in
the same state in 1540 as it now is, and that it is the work of a notary who is of fre-
quent occurrence from 1488 to 1512. It is a pretty accurate transcript, leaving no
doubt of the original from which it was formed3 since it not only preserves the same
order, but frequently copies twice charters‚ which occur twice in the older chartulary,
repeats the most manifest errors, and occasionally leaves a blank where the wrifing,
in the more ancient record, is decayed, or otherwise difficult to decipher. ¹

The latter part of this volume, like the other, consists of the charters and writs of
the Bishoprick, of date subsequent to the period at which the previous part was
copied, and for the most part entered at the time of the transactions they record.

The first half of each volume of these records of the See may be said generally to
record the growth and acquisitiones the Church property3 while the latter part of
both relates to its dismemberment and total alienation.

The part of the record which has been conjectured to be the Bishop's registcr has
been printed first: Next, the Liber Decam'; the charters of St Nicholas's Hospital3
and the muniments of the Maison Dz'eu. No other liberty has been taken with these,
except attempting to arrange the documents in each in chronological order. They
have been printed from thc older register 3 and the later chartulary has only been
used on the rare occasions where it offered a manifest improvement on the text of its
original. Where the same writ occurred in two of these records, it has been printed
only in the first, but always from a collation of both.

The remaining materials of both chartularies, previous in date to the commence-

ιι “ 2 die mensis Maii 1540. Compertum est
“ quod sunt hucusque centum et duo solia manu
“ quondam domini Donaldi Thome scripta seu
“ registrata coram reverendo in Christo patre et
“ domino Patricio miseratione divina Moravi-
“ ensi episcopo monasteriique de Scona corn-

“ mendatario perpetuo.

“ sarius.'’—jbl. 108.

Γ At the commencement is the same invoca-
tion, so sar as the scribe could deciphcr it, and
at the end of the Liber Decani the same thanks-

giving (fil. l. sol. 28.)-.the charter os Urchard
is twice engresscd‚ as in the old chartulary
(jbl. 29, 31 .)—and the charters that occur, both
iu the Liber Decam' and the Bishop's Register,
are copied twice. The writer has begun to
transcribe the charter of Ratemorchus by Alex-
ander 11. (N. 29.) which occurs on sulio 38. of
the older chartulary, and has stoppcd, from the
difficulty of dcciphering his originaLwhich iu ex-
tremely faint, but not illegible. Reyist. vetust.
