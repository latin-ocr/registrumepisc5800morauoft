It is much to be regretted that this is of so low a date as 1565; and it must be
remembered that long before that time, the Church property had been grievously
dilapidated, and there then existed very palpable motives for understating the
value of the Church benefices, which were heavily taxed for the Crown, and for the
ministers of the Reformed Church.

At the end of the volume are placed a few original charters, intended to illustrate

'um‘ either the antiquities of the district, which forms the subject of the preceding eom-

pilation, or of some of the families whose deedS, either of munificent endowment or
of aggression against the Church of Moray, are there recorded.

The Bishoprick of Moray has been more fortunate than the other districts of Scot-
land, in forming the subject of the labours of a diligent and zealous local historian.
Shaw’s “ History of the Province of Moray,’'th0ugh awkwardly arranged, and defective
in many particulars, may yet boast of being the best district history of Scotland. He
derived his information in general from authentia sources3 and, among other mate-
rials, made use of the Chartulary of the Bishoprick. It seems now indeed wonderful
that the acccss to such sources of knowledge, and the aeknowledged care and industry
of the author, did not produce a more learned and satisfactory work. But it must
be remembered that the study of historical antiquities was in his time in its infancy3
and that, in Scotland, the Reformation produced such a revolution in laws, customs‚
manners, and even language, that it is still like venturing to talk in a foreign
tongue, for a Scotchman to enter upon the field of ancient ecclesiastical institutions.
It is to be hoped that the publication of works like the prese'nt may tend to remove
this difficulty, without which it is impossible to reach the foundation of local statistics.

This Diocese extended over the shire of Elgin and Forres, or Moray proper,
Nairnshire‚ and a large portion of the shires of Inverness and Banff. The Sheriff-
dom of Elgin and Fames, in which the Episcopal See was situate‚ and which is
properly called Moray, has always been the subject of the warm and exaggerated
