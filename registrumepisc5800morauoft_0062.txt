Boece, who, aster repeating Fordun's account
of the Council of Northampton‚ and the pas-
sionate defcnce of the libertics of the Scottish
Church by the Clerk Gilbert, adds—“ Gilberms
“ hic postea effectus Episcopus Cathenensisl' and
he is followed by Leslie, Camerarius, Dempster,
and Spotiswoode. It is edifying to observe how
the mistake grows in its progress, until we
find Balfour, with a glorious contempt of con-
sistency aud dates, setting down in 1178, “This

'“ yeir, also, K. William made Gilbert, a learned

“ man, chamberlane of Scotland, and Bis. of
“ Cathnes: This is that Gilbcrt that stood out
“ so stifly for the liberty of the Church of Scot-
“land against Roger, Archbis. of York, and
“ all the prelats os England.”-(Ammls). Now
if we suppose the champion of the Scottish
Church against the prelatos of England in 1176,
to have been but thirty years of age, he must
have been scvcnty-six years old when Gilbert de
Moravia was made Bishop of Caithness, and
about onc hundred when he died. Ifwe join to
this the inconsistency of attributing a rapid rise
in offices of Church and State to the distinguish-
ed part he took in the Council,—-while it would
appear that Gilbert de Moravia's promotion to
the Bishoprie took place forty-six years aster
the date os that Couucil,--it seems plain that
these were different persons ς and it is probablc
that the coincidence of the name of Gilbert was
the only foundat‘mn for joining the acts os both
to swell the character of one saint.

While it would appear then, that Gilbcrt de
Moravia must renounce the honour of having
vindicatcd the independence of the Scottish
Church, it seems also doubtful whether hc held
the office of Chamberlain of Scotland. Thongh
occurriug repeatcdly both as a granter and as a
witness of ehartcrs, he nowhere bears this style,
nor does any Chamberlain appear of the name of
Gilbert in any authentic instrument till long

Before finally leaving this subject, it must be allowed briefly to notice the
indication of an early connexion between this great family and the illustrious house

aster his death. The venerable brcviary of
Aberdeen and the older legends are in this mat-
ter better guides than our old historians, since,
in the midst of popular tales of miracles, they at
least avoid great historical anachronisms. We
learn from them that Saint Gilbert was of a noble
Seotch family 3 that he was in great favour with
King William and Alexander 11. 3 by whom, it
is said, he was employed in administering the
affairs os government in the North of Scotland,
and especially in building and fortifying castles
for the security of the district. This part of
thc history may have been introduced only to
ground a story of the miraculous recovery os
certain account-books, aster thoy had been burnt
by some os his cnemies; and it is very probable
that there is no other foundation for the asser-
tion of his having been high Chamberlain. It
may readily bc conceived, however, tuat in a
district just reclaimed from foreign rule, this
new Bishap, nearly connected wlth the great
lords os the territory, must have eujoycd con-
siderable power 3 and we receive without scruple
the statement of the legends, that he exercised
his influence with Alexander to mitigate tho
punishment of the pcoplc of Caithness for the
murder of Adam, his predecessor, and that he
was entrusted with the building of fon-tressa< fm-
the protection of the country, while he certain-
ly founded the Cathedral Church at Dornoch.
His miracles are not distinguished by any ori-
ginality‚ if we except the singular boon conser-
red by him on a certain tenant of salmon-fisb-
eries, who, in despair at the unproductivencss of
the sea-son, and the approach of rent-day, intrent-
ed the Saint to wash his hands in the river; which
was no sooner done than an abundant draught ot*
tish rcpaid his saith. Saint Gilbert died on the
lst April, 1245, and is said to have becn buricd
under the ccntral tower of his own cathedral.
