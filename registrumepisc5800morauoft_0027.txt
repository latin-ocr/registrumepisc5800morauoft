taineers of the interior, which it attracted by its superior fertility‚ Moray must have
suffered numerous changes of its population. Nothing, however, ean be a greater
error than to conclude that each successful invasion, or even every conquest, effected
a complete change of thednhabitants. In barbarous times, and in Scotland as else-
where, a ocnquered native population became a valuable part of the spoil of the
victors. Not so much employed henceforward in war as in agriculture and the
peaceful arts, it was less exposed to the hazards of successive conquests and revolu-
tions. Even among the warrior ranks, it is unreasonable to suppose that every war
was to extermination. Some part would owe their preservation to humanity, some
to policy or fear. However preserved, in the lapse of ages, and in constant political
agitation, the races must have become mixed 3 and if it be asserted that one predo-
minates‚ we may conclude that it is of those energetic races before whom the Celtic
people have always yielded, and who have left their impress over all Britain, and
perhaps nowhere more than in Moray and the adjoining coast of Buchan. Whether
this be so or not can be gathered from no other source than the antiquities of the
district, and the featurs, manneres, and language of the inhabitants. These are suffi-
ciently fallacious guides in such an enquiry, but more to be relied upon than the
meagre gleanings of Northern Sagas and Irish chronicles, or the genealogies of
dreaming seanachies. ¹‘

k The acknowledged fabulousness of our own
historians has naturally enough diverted the
allegiance of later writers to one or other of
those authorities. They are all useful, and all
to be received with distrust, and weighed against
each other, as well as tested by the common rules
of evidence.

There is a romantio exaggeration and a poe-
tical cast of diction in the Sagas, which throw
suspicion on their historical accuracy. Even if
we hold the writers to intend their works to pass
for sober, veracious narrative, we have much to
allow for their imperfect information when they
speak of foreign events. Their accounts of ex-
peditions for piraey or conquest were necessarily
drawn from the boastful reports of the returning
heroes3 and bear the character of rhapsodies
framed to their honour, rather than sober accounts
of real actions. They were peculiarly ignorant
regarding Scotland, perhaps from the unknown

Ianguage of part of its people ; and they mistake
excessively, where they do not altogether despise,
the geographical features and nomenclature of
the country.

The Irish chronicles present us with little
more than a series of obits‚ and a vast confusion
of fights. The descriptions of the parties are so
loosely given, that they can generally be read
with various meanings. They are a sort of
authority most convenient for founding theol-ies.
They serve equally well for opposite sides.

The internal history of the Highlands of Scot-
land, andwith it the Highland peffigrees, are but of
yesterday, when compared with those of England
and the Lowlands of Scotland. There appears
to be no evidence of Highland Gaelic writing till
towards the end of the fifteenth century ς and
even since that period, the written literature and
records of the Highlanders are limited to a few
strings of names, arranged like pedigrees, with-
