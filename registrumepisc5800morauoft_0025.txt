praises of its inhabitants 3 and some of our historians, who have ever loved any
thing approaching to the marvellous, have rated this fine northern region much
above more favoured southern elimes. Buchanan is satisfied with describing Moray
as ‘⁶ frugibus et pascuis foecunda, amoenitate vero et fructiferarum arborum proventu
“ totius regni facile prima.'' Bishop Leslie, by birth, education‚ and benefice
attached to the North, dwells more feelingly on its perfections :—⁶‘ Regio est una
‘⁶ prae caeteris omnibus apud nos ob amoenitatem celebrata. Est enim plana,
‘⁶ minime palustris, quae crebro saltu, odoriferis herbis, pratis, tritico, omni frumenti
‘⁶ genere, pomiferis hortis, ac littore finitimo plurimum delectat. Illic aura salu-
“ berrima, rariores multo nebulae atque pluviae quam usquam alibi, atque adeo
‘⁶ magna propterea nobilium virorum seges.”

A writer, to whom Scotland owes more than to many historians, has given us a
description of Moray, somewhat later in date, which derives additional value from
the author's near neighbourhood and necessary acquaintance with the district. Sir
Robert Gordon of Straloch¹² says, that “in salubrity of climate, Moray is not
‘⁶ inferior to any, and in richness and fertility of soil, it much exceeds our other
‘⁶ northern provinces. The air is so temperate, that when all around is bound up
⁶⁶ in the rigour of winter, there are neither lasting snows nor such frosts as damage
⁶⁶ fruits or trees ; proving the truth of that boast of the natives‚ that they have
‘⁶ forty days more of fine weather in every year than the neighbouring districts.
‘⁶ There is no product of this kingdom which does not there thrive perfectly 3 or if
‘⁶ any fail, it is to be attributed to the sloth of the inhabitants, not to the fault of the
‘⁶ soil or climate. Corn, the earth pours forth in wonderful and never-failing abund-
⁶⁶ ance. Fruits of all sorts, herbs, flowers, pulse, are in the greatest plenty, and all
‘⁶ early. While harvest has scarce begun in surrounding districts, there all is ripe,
‘⁶ and cut down, and carried into open barn-yards, as is the custom of the country ;
⁶⁶ and, in comparison with other districts, winter is hardly felt. The earth is almost
‘⁶ always open, the sea navigable, and the roads never stopped. So much of the soil
‘⁶ is occupied by crops of corn, however, that pasture is scarce ς for this whole
⁶⁶ district is devoted to corn and tillage. But pasture is found at no great distance,
‘⁶ and is abundant in the upland country, a few miles inland, and thither the oxen
‘⁶ are sent to graze in summer, when the labour of the season is over. Nowhere
