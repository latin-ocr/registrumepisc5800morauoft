XXXVIII

Quhen Wiliame Walas dyd his payne,
To suecoure the Kynrik of Scotland.'‘ r
He was slain in 1297. He left two sons, of whom John the younger was ancestor
of the De Moravias of Drumsargard and Abercairney ; the eldest was
Sm ANDREW Moray of Bothwell, the illustrious Wardane of Scotland; he died in

1338 3—

“ Oure the Mownth than pessit he
Til Avawch in his awync cuntre,
And thare than cndyt he his dayis.

In the K.yrk ciathed⁰yrale⁶of Rosmarkyne

That nobil Knycht wes ι nteryde syne.” ε
He married Christian, the sister of Bruce, and held the office of Panetarius Reyis,
which was also held in succession by his two sons, John and Thomas.

J om«, the eldest son, along with his great southern possessions‚ retained the antient
family lands of Artrillie and Croy, out of which he endowed a ehaplainrie in the
cathedral church of Elgin, for the soul of his father of good memory, Sir Andrew de
Moravia, in 1351.t He seems to have died without issue, as both his office and
estates came to his brother,

TrioMAs de Moravia, who confirmed the grant of John to the church of Moray,
in 1353,²¹ and died in 1361, while in England as one of the hostages for King
David 11. He left an only child,

Jonn, who carried the estates of Bothwell and the possessions in the North to
Archibald third Earl of Douglas.

The pedigrees of these three lines of De Moravia may be said to be proved from
this Register. In the preceding statement two generations may be thrown into one,
or a single life divided; but there cannot be any doubt with regard to the general
line of descent of each, and their mutual connexion. A more extensive and accurate
investigation will assuredly remove the obscurity that surrounds the first two des-
cents, and supply information of several marriages and collateral descendant& Such
an enquiry, properly conducted, can hardly fail also to throw light on the interesting
but obscure subject of thc history of the Earldoms of Stratherne and Casthness, in
both of which the several lines of De Moravia were nearly interested.
