Tulibardyn² in Perthshire. It is difficult to hold it a mere accidental coincidence,
that, on the banks of the Lossy, in the midst of the possessions of the Northern De
Mol-avias, a small property bore the same name of Tulibardyn so early as the epis-
copate of Andrew de Moravia‚ who died in 1242. f It is now perhaps impossible to
say which of these places, so distant from each other, first bore the name, but that
one was named from the other is at least probable. Such an importation of the
name of some favourite former residence has been at all times common in Seotland,
and frequently confounds the modern topographer. It is here immaterial to settle
the question of precedency, since the inference of the connexion of the Perthshire
family with that of Morayshire arises equally, whether the name was transplanted
from Stratherne to Elgin, or from the banks of the Lossy to Perthshire. ἕ

² The ascertained pedigree of the ancestor of Tulibardyn and of his wife is as follows :-
