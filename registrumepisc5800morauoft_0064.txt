Upon the argument of Wyntoun‚ derived from the similarity of the arms of the
two families, his editor MacPherson throws discredit, and says, it “shows how little
‘⁶ people then knew of what was going forward even among themselves ;”ἲ and he
asserts that the stars formed no part of the Douglases arms until their marriage with
the heiress of the Morays of Bothwell. He treats the authority of Godscroft with
contempt, for stating that ‘⁶ the ancient arms of the house of Douglas were three
‘⁵ mollets or stars only, in a field azure, until good Sir James did add the crowned
“ heart.” But Home is more accurate than his wont in this matter ; and when he
states that he himself had seen the seal of william of Douglas appended to an inden-
ture of 1259, and that ‘⁶ the arms seemed to be three stars or mollets at the upper

come down to us, so old as the time of Sir James, the companion of Brucc. But his
nephew William, the first Earl of Douglas, appears to have been curious in heraldry,
and was probably the first of the family who adopted the heart (not yet crowned) in
commemoration of his uncle‘s honoured trust. He had three, if not four seals‚ used

reason to doubt that Freskinus (named probably
after his uncle of Kcrdal, and who is first known
