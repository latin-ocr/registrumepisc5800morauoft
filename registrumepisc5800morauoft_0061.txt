But if the evidence that the Morays of Atholl spi-ang from the northern stock be
held conclusive, the more difficult question remains behind, at what point they
branched off. It would be idle to offer a conjecture regarding a matter which may
yet be fully ascertained, were it not that it may perhaps serve to throw some
light, or point the way for future researches. We find that Gilbert‚ the Arch-
deacon of Moray, afterwards Bishop of Caithness‚ had two brothers, Richard de
Moravia of Culbin, to whom he gave the lands of Skelbo before 1235, and J ohn,¹¹¹ of
whom no more is known with certainty. The date of this personage would precisely
agree with the first appearance of John de Moravia‚ the first of that surname in
Perthshire3 and the rank of his connexions might account for him and his immediate
descendants so soon taking the station which they appear to have held in that coun-
try. Unfortunately we are again left to conjecture what was the parentage of .
Gilbert the Archdeacon himself ; for although it is plain from the terms of the
charter of Hugo Freskyn, and from other circumstances, that he was nearly related
to the chief family of De Moravia‚ we nowhere find the name of his father, or of any
of his relatives, except the two brothers above-mentioned. In the absence of better
authorities, we are induced to trust to an anonymous scribe, who has noted on the
margin of the older chartulary, at a deed of Gilbert‚ Bishop of Caithness : ¹¹—

· 'stt &immas erat ἥῐίιιέ numini ve fflnffttss ·

If the annotator be correct, Gilbert‚ John, and Riehard must all apparently have
been sons of William, son of Freskyn, Lord of Duffus, and nephews of Hugo

Freskyn, the ancestor of the House of Sutherland.⁰

⁰ Of Gilbert de Moravia‚ Archdeacon of
Momy, Bishop of Caithness, and Saint, our in-
formation is scanty and unsatisfactory ; for we
have to choose between the legends of the me-
nology and the more mischievous confusion of
history and fable of some of our Scotch histo-
rians. All we know of him for certain is that
he was Archdeacon of Moray, apparently during
the whole episcopate of Bishop Bricius, 1203-

1222, and was Bishop of Caithness from 1222
till 1245. He is usually said to have attended
the Council of Northampton in 1176; but this
seems to be au invention of later date than
Fordun and the Aberdeen breviary. Fordun
indeed celebrates, as the hero of that Council,
quendam clericum Scotum, Gilbertam nomine
(Heame, iii. p. 714.) 3 to which Bower, his con-
tinuator, adds, “ Fertur hunc esse Gz'lbertum
“ quem postea Rea: camerarium requi ficit, de-
¹‘ hinc ad episcopatum Cathena-mem provexim- et
“modo sanctus miraculis claret.’¹—(Goodall‚
p. 478). This was a sufficient foundation for
