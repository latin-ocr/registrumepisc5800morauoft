F indhorn and the Ness there were certainly not less than four‚u and probably from
the terms of one charter,¹ a great many more. These were of small extent, often less
than a single parish. It would appear that the whole district of Moray having
lapsed to the crown, whether by forfeiture or otherways‚ while many portions
were granted by Malcolm and William, and theirimmediate successors, in frank tene-
mentor baronage, subject only to the burden of military service, a large part still
remained the property of the sovereign, who granted it either in lease for a limited
period, οι· in perpetual feu-farm for the payment of a certain money rent. There
is sufficient evidence in this chartulary that the feuars, or perpetual tenants, even of
small portions of those crown lands‚ bore the title of Thane. These words are not
only used synonymously‚ but the precise relation is marked in more than one place,
which the thane bore to the villain on the one hand, and the dominus, or lord of a
fief, on the otl1er.v

There is reason to believe that the administrators or stewards of certain portions of
Crown lands, and sometimes even the tenants removable at pleasure, were also desig-
nated Thanes3 ² and in one instance we find the title borne, and evidently hereditary for
generations, in right of lands not even held directly of the Crown, but paying a rent

and liable for service of vassalage to a subject superior.³

ἢ Robcrt the Steward of Scotland, afterwards
King Robcrt 11.‚ before his accession to the
throne, granted, as Lord of Athol‚ to Eugenius,
Thanc of Glcntilt, brother of Reginald de In-
sulis, and his heirs, the Thanage os Glentilt, sor
a rent of ll merks sterling, and the service of
four horses once a-ycar in his Lord's hunting in
Bencromby 3 with the condition that if the said
thanage by any calamity should not be worth so
much as ll merks, the rent should be fixed by an
assize of thc vicinagc.

This property was held of the Earls of Athol
by the successive descendants of Eugenius, who
are styled for several generations, “ thanus⁰
and “ Ie thane'' de Glcntilt. They appear lat-
tcrly to have adopted a surname from their

tenure3 and while we find one of the family
styled simply “ John Thane son and apparent
“ heir of Fyndlans the thane of Glentilt‚'‘ the
same Fynlay is designated “ Finlay 'rosselmch‘'
in several instruments connected with the final
conveyance of the property by him to the family
of Athol‚ in the beginning of the sixteenth cen-
tury. The Gaelic term Tosclzach is rendered
by Skene and others an (ffcer or mair. It has
more latcly been stated to mean the eldest cadet
of a Highland elan. It cannot perhaps be pre-
sumed without more evidence, that it was here
used as the precise translation of the Scotch
thane and the thanus of the charters3 but its
being used uniformly for those terms in the writs
mentioned, with the whole circumstances of the
base holding, snfficicntly prove that the office of
thane was not of high rank or dignity.

The charters of this thanedom-thanayz'um
Ahnathie sive le thmzdom (Ie Glentilt—as it is
sometimes called, are preserved in the charter-
chest of his Grace the Duke os Athon.
