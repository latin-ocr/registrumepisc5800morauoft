It is certainly difficult to account for the appearance of this Saxon title only in the
Northern districts of Scotland. b It may be conjectured that the new Saxon rulers
found in the North some tenure or office which it was not expedient to abolish, and
which bore sufficient resemblance to that of their Thanes, to lead to the latter title
being generally applied to it.

Those circles of erect stones, sometimes called Druids’ circles, and known all over smmum-
Scotland by the vulgar name of standing stones‚ seem to have retained their original ΗΘΜ*
use, as places of meeting for the solemnities of justice, in the North country longer
than elsewhere. We find the King's J usticiar, with a great array of counsellors and
attendants, holding a solemn court for the trial of a case at the standing-stenes of
Rane, in 1349. ⁶ A similar instance occurs in the present volume, where, in 1380,
Alexander Stewart, Lord of Badenoch‚ in the most formal manner, cites the holders
of certain lands in Badenoch to appear and produce their titles to their lands at the
Standand Stanys of the Rathe of Kyngucy. Amongst others, the Bishop of Moray
appeared upon this citation, not, however, to prove his title to his lands of Badenoch‚
but to protest against the jurisdiction and whole proceedings of the Earl, whom he
refused to acknowledge as his Over Lord. The approach of the Bishop to the court,
his formal protest, the disregard with which it was treated, and the whole proceedings
of the Court‚ are described much more graphically than was the wont of notaries
public.d

There are not many circumstances in this record illustrative of the condition of the snm.
natives or serfs bound to the soil. Lord Hailes has pointed out a passage, from which
it appears that even the cler-gy were not exempt from a state of servitude.e Here
is also to be found perhaps the latest occurrence of enforcing the laws of servitude.

, In 1364, Alexander, Bishop of Moray‚ having sued out a brieve from the King’s

Chapel for the recovery of his serfs, appeared in the Sheriff-court of Banff, and

d The next day the Bishop seems to have
prevailed more effectually in a private expostu-
lation ; and we have it recorded that in the
Castle of Ruthven, in the great chamber behind
the hall, the Earl, in presence of all his council‚

annulled the whole process and decree of the
court held the day before, and eut them from
the roll of court, and gave them to the Bishop's
notary to be burned ; who certifies that he cast
them with his own hands into a great fire lighted

in the said chamber, and saw them consumed.
