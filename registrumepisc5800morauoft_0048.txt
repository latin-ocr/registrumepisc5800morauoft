obtained the verdict of an assize finding that the three men claimed by him were

Of merely local antiquities this volume has not much to boast. It reeords the
existence of a very ancient bridge over Spey, the exact date of which is unknown ;
but its existence and support in the beginning of the thirteenth century mark a
greater advancement than we are prepared to expect in that district. ⁸

Among the local antiquitieS, some descriptions of marches which occur not indeed
in the register itself‚ but among the charters appended to it, give rise to interesting
speculation. One of these in describing the boundaries of the lands of Burgie as

fixed by perambulation, gives a number of Gaelie places which, fortunately for the ·

antiquary‚ are translated into Scotch, upon a parchment attached to the charter. ¹¹ All
of these are eurious, but one is peculiarly interesting. Beginning at the great Oak
marked with a eross, the boundary ran by a place or object named Rune Pictorum,
which is translated ‘⁶ the Carne of the Pethis‚ or the Pechts feildis.'' This is perhaps
the only allusion to the Pictish people to be found in any Scotch charter3 and if it
shall be found upon tracing the boundary, that the expression has reference to the
sculptured pillar situate at the east end of the town of Fortes, an authority so ancient
as the time of Alexander 11.‚ for aseribing that extraordinary monument to the

ancient Pictish inhabitants, must be regarded as an important element in a very
carious inquiry.¹

Β It appears to have been situate at the pas-
sage of the Spey. still called the Boat of Brigg,
where a new bridge has been lately erected.
The hospital os St Nicholas, erected close to the
bridgc, and endowed sor the reception of tra-
veum-s, is now probably no longer to be traced.
lt is said that some remains of the foundations
of the ancient bridge were lately visible. The
superstructure was probably of wood.-Sl1a11-‚

ἲ· “Peryameno assuto.'' These charters of
Kinloss are printed from copies of the accurate
Macfarlane. Unsortunately he does not men-
tion where the original charters are, and the
efforts to find them have been uusueeess-
ful. It is of course impossible to ascertain

the age of the translations appended to this

charter.—Ap. 4.

³ One local custom perhaps requires expla-
nation. In the process of perambulation of
Abirkerdour‚ an oath is taken “ upon the flrtir
“ of Sauct Mcrnane‚'' and afterwards ‘¹ capite
“ Sancti Marnani presentc.''—N. 203. This
was the same Saintly person in whose honour
a chapelry was endowed ou the banks of the
Dovern (N. 218), and to whom the church of
Abirkerdour where he was buried, was dedi-
cated. The “firm'' (feretrum) was the shrine
in which the Saint's head was treasured, which
was washed with much solemnity each Sunday,
and the water used in the ablution, being drank,
operated as a miraculous and sovereign remedy
for all diseases.--(Breviar. Aberdon. 1 Mar.)
