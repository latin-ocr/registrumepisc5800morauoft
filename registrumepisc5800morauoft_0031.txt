of Lincoln, which he ascertained by a mission to England. He brought with him
into? Moray his brothers Archibald, Alexander, Hugh, Henry, and probably Fres-
kinus, and provided for some of them by grants of lands, for others as beneficed
churchmen. The promotion of their brother to the Bishoprick, and perhaps the
connexion with the great Northern family already mentioned, seems to have laid the
first foundation of the power of the family of Douglas‚ whose name before this period
is scarcely known in history. Bricius died in 1222. Υ

ANDREw de Moravia succeeded in 1222, ² but was not consecrated till after 1223.
He was probably the son of Hugh de Moravia, Lord of Duffus, and, before being
raised to the Bishoprick, Parson of Duffus, in which character he consented to the
erection of the chapel. ² In his time—in 1224—the transference of the Episcopal
See and the Cathedral of the Diocese to Elgin was effected, which had probably been
designed and solicited by his predecessor. This Bishop probably built the Cathedral
church ; ¹³ and he at different times, and chiefly by munificent endowments obtained
from his own relatives, of the families of De Moravia of Duffus and Petty‚ increased
the number of prebends in the Cathedral to twenty-three 3⁶ of which the Bishop held
one, and sat as a simple undignified canon in the chapter. ‘¹ Andrew died in 1242.ε
